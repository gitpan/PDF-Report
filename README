Dist version 1.20 
=================

PDF::Report is written around Alfred Reibenschuh's PDF::API2.  It provides
methods to create a PDF document with text, lines, color and graphics. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  PDF::API2 >= 0.3r74

  NOTE:  You can use an older version of PDF::API2, but don't expect things 
         like text color, text underlining, or the addParagraph routine to work 
         correctly if at all!  Just edit the makefile to get this to install.  
         Best to use a RELEASE and not an ALPHA or BETA.

Optional (If you want to use roman numerals when numbering pages):

  Text::Roman >= 3.02
